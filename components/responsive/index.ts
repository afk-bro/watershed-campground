/**
 * Responsive Primitives
 *
 * A collection of components that encode mobile-first responsive patterns.
 * Use these instead of solving responsiveness page-by-page.
 *
 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * import { PageShell, ResponsiveStack, DataCard } from '@/components/responsive';
 *
 * <PageShell>
 *   <ResponsiveStack gap="4">
 *     <DataCard fields={...} />
 *   </ResponsiveStack>
 * </PageShell>
 * ```
 */

export { PageShell } from './PageShell';
export { ResponsiveStack } from './ResponsiveStack';
export { ResponsiveGrid } from './ResponsiveGrid';
export { DataCard } from './DataCard';
export { BottomSheet } from './BottomSheet';
